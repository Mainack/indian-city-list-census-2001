|| U.A.|Urban Agglomeration is a continuous urban spread constituting a town and its adjoining urban outgrowths (OGs) or two or more physically contiguous towns together and any adjoining urban outgrowths of such towns. Examples of OGs are railway colony, university campus, port areas, etc. , that may come up near a city or statutory town outside its statutory limits but within the revenue limits of a village or villages contiguous to the town or city. In 2001 Census, for the purpose of delineation of Urban Agglomerations the pre-requisite criteria were: (a) The core town or at least one of the constituent towns of an UA should necessarily be a statutory town; and (b) the total population of all the constituents (i.e., towns and outgrowths) of an Urban Agglomeration should not be less than 20,000 (as per 1991 Census).|
